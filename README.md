We are a team of 4 students who participated in the [2023 NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/):

- Aryan Jain
- Harsh Kumar
- Ayush Singh
- Mannraj Saluja

NASA Space Apps Challenge is an annual hackathon event (or an innovation incubation and civic engagement program) where NASA puts out about 31 challenges for participants around the world to develop innovative solutions.

We are excited and honored to be the part of this global hackathon.



<!-- We are excited and honored to be [one of 35 Global Finalists](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/awards/global-finalists/), which were selected from 5,327 teams worldwide (31,561 participants from 162 countries) by NASA and 10 other space agencies!-->

<!-- We participated in the Boston division of Space Apps and won the **1st place** there! We are excited to be be [one of global nominees](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/boston/teams)!-->

Our team worked on the ["Analysis of IMF Vectors To predict the occurence of magnetic reconnection in GeoMagnetic space near Earth" challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/magnetic-reconnection/) to "create a computer program for the public that analyzes the IMF vector components measured by spacecraft to assess how often magnetic reconnection occurs."

This web site provides  software setup, Data diagrams, and ready-to-run Python programs. You can immediately Know the analysis of next Reconnection Occurence. We hope you find this project interesting and useful and then learn something about space weather. You can even join us to spread the word and data about space weather with this Software!

### Short Project Summary


We developed a computer program that uses statistical and spectral analysis of the IMF vector components measured by spacecraft to assess how often magnetic reconnection occurs. This information is vital for understanding how often solar wind particles and energy gain access into the geospace environment and potentially cause space weather effects.

Our program is user-friendly and easy to use, and it does not require any prior knowledge of programming or statistics. It is a valuable tool for scientists and researchers who are studying magnetic reconnection and its impact on space weather, as well as for the public who are interested in learning more about space science and space weather.


### Detailed Project Summary

High-level summary of the project: We developed a Python-based IMF vector analyzer that uses linear regression to predict the date, time, and IMF vectors of magnetic reconnection events using data from the NASA satellites ACE, WIND, and DSCOVR. How it solves the challenge: The challenge was to develop a computer program for the public that performs statistical and/or spectral analysis of the vector components of the IMF measured by the ACE, WIND, and DSCOVR missions to assess how often magnetic reconnection occurs. Our program solves this challenge by using linear regression to predict the date, time, and IMF vectors of magnetic reconnection events. This information is vital for understanding how often solar wind particles and energy gain access into the geospace environment and potentially cause space weather effects. Why it is important: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in space physics that plays a major role in space weather. By understanding how often magnetic reconnection occurs and how it is related to the IMF, we can better predict space weather events and mitigate their impact on our infrastructure and technology. Best contain: Our program is important because it provides a way for the public to access and analyze IMF data to learn more about magnetic reconnection and space weather. It is also important because it is a valuable tool for scientists and researchers who are studying magnetic reconnection and its impact on space weather. Additional benefits: Our program is also user-friendly and easy to use. It does not require any prior knowledge of programming or statistics. It also provides users with the ability to customize the analysis settings to meet their specific needs.

What exactly does it do?

The IMF vector analyzer takes as input data from the NASA satellites ACE, WIND, and DSCOVR. This data includes the Bx, By, and Bz components of the IMF, as well as the timestamp. The analyzer then uses linear regression to predict the date, time, and IMF vectors of magnetic reconnection events.

How does it work?

The IMF vector analyzer works by first training a linear regression model on the historical IMF data. This model is trained to predict the date, time, and IMF vectors of magnetic reconnection events given the Bx, By, and Bz components of the IMF. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the date, time, and IMF vectors of future magnetic reconnection events.

What benefits does it have?

The IMF vector analyzer has a number of benefits, including:

It is easy to use and does not require any prior knowledge of programming or statistics.
It can be used to predict the date, time, and IMF vectors of future magnetic reconnection events.
It is a valuable tool for scientists and researchers who are studying magnetic reconnection and its impact on space weather.
It can be used by the public to learn more about magnetic reconnection and space weather.
What do you hope to achieve?

We hope to achieve the following with our IMF vector analyzer:

Make it easier for scientists and researchers to study magnetic reconnection and its impact on space weather.
Educate the public about magnetic reconnection and space weather.
Help to mitigate the impact of space weather events on our infrastructure and technology.
What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did you use to develop your project?

We used the following tools, coding languages, hardware, and software to develop our IMF vector analyzer:

Python programming language
NumPy and Pandas libraries
Scikit-learn library
Google Cloud Platform for hosting the analyzer and storing the data
We used Python because it is a popular and versatile programming language that is well-suited for scientific computing. We used NumPy and Pandas libraries for numerical and data analysis, and we used the Scikit-learn library for machine learning. We used Google Cloud Platform for hosting the analyzer and storing the data because it is a powerful and reliable platform.
