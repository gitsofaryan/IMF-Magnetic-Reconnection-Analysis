		<h2>About</h2>
		<p id="p1">
			India decided to go to space when Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was set up by 
the Government of India in 1962. With the visionary Dr Vikram Sarabhai at its helm, INCOSPAR set up the 
Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in Thiruvananthapuram for upper atmospheric research.

Indian Space Research Organisation, formed in 1969, superseded the erstwhile INCOSPAR. Vikram Sarabhai, 
having identified the role and importance of space technology in a Nation's development, provided ISRO the 
necessary direction to function as an agent of development. ISRO then embarked on its mission to provide the 
Nation space based services and to develop the technologies to achieve the same independently.

Throughout the years, ISRO has upheld its mission of bringing space to the service of the common man, 
to the service of the Nation. In the process, it has become one of the six largest space agencies in the world. 
ISRO maintains one of the largest fleet of communication satellites (INSAT) and remote sensing (IRS) satellites, 
that cater to the ever growing demand for fast and reliable communication and earth observation respectively. 
ISRO develops and delivers application specific satellite products and tools to the Nation: broadcasts, communications, 
weather forecasts, disaster management tools, Geographic Information Systems, cartography, navigation, telemedicine, 
dedicated distance education satellites being some of them.

        <h3>Mars Orbiter Mission</h3>
		<div class="box1"><img src="img/mom.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div id="first">
        <P id="p2">
            The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan ("Mars-craft", from Sanskrit: मंगल mangala, "Mars" and यान yāna, "craft, vehicle"),is a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).It is India's first interplanetary mission[15] and ISRO has also become the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency.It is the first Asian nation to reach Mars orbit, and the first nation in the world to do so in its first attempt.

            The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013.The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.

            The mission is a "technology demonstrator" project to develop the technologies for designing, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission.It carries five instruments that will help advance knowledge about Mars to achieve its secondary, scientific objective.The spacecraft is currently being monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bangalore with support from Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennae at Byalalu, Karnataka.

        <h4>Chandryaan-1</h4>
		<div class="box1"><img src="img/c-1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div id="second">
        <p id="p3">
           Chandrayaan-1 (Sanskrit: [ t͡ʃʌnd̪ɾʌːjaːn]; lit: Moon vehicle About this sound pronunciation (help·info)) was India's first lunar probe. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft using a PSLV-XL rocket, serial number C11,on 22 October 2008 at 00:52 UTC from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, about 80 km (50 mi) north of Chennai.Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced the project on course in his Independence Day speech on 15 August 2003. The mission was a major boost to India's space program,as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon.The vehicle was inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.

           On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 14:36 UTC and struck the south pole in a controlled manner, making India the fourth country to place its flag on the Moon.The probe hit near the crater Shackleton at 15:01 UTC, ejecting sub-surface soil that could be analysed for the presence of lunar water ice.

           The estimated cost for the project was ₹386 crore (US$54 million).

           The remote sensing lunar satellite had a mass of 1,380 kg (3,040 lb) at launch and 675 kg (1,488 lb) in lunar orbit. It carried high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it was intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and three-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest as they might contain ice. The lunar mission carried five ISRO payloads and six payloads from other space agencies including NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency, which were carried free of cost. Among its many achievements, the greatest achievement was the discovery of the widespread presence of water molecules in the lunar soil.

           After almost a year, the orbiter started suffering from several technical issues including failure of the star sensors and poor thermal shielding; Chandrayaan stopped sending radio signals about 20:00 UTC on 28 August 2009, shortly after which the ISRO officially declared the mission over. Chandrayaan operated for 312 days as opposed to the intended two years but the mission achieved 95% of its planned objectives.

           On 2 July 2016, NASA used ground-based radar systems to relocate Chandrayaan-1 in its lunar orbit, more than seven years after it shut down.Repeated observations over the next three months allowed a precise determination of its orbit which varies between 150 and 270 km (93 and 168 mi) in altitude every two years

        <h5>Satelite Launch Record(PSLv-C37)</h5>
		<div class="box1"><img src="img/pslv.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div id="third">    
        <p id="p4">
           PSLV-C37 was the 39th mission of the Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) program and its 16th mission in the XL configuration. PSLV-C37 successfully carried and deployed a record 104 satellites in sun-synchronous orbits. Launched on 15 February 2017 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, it broke the earlier record of launching 37 satellites by a Russian Dnepr rocket on 19 June 2014. According to ISRO, the 101 international satellites were launched as part of a commercial arrangement between several firms and its commercial arm Antrix Corporation Limited, run under the auspices of the Indian Government's Department of Space.
            
           PSLV-C37 was launched from the First Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota at 09:28 IST on 15 February 2017. It was the 39th flight of the PSLV and the sixteenth in the XL configuration.[1] It carried a total of 104 satellites including the primary payload Cartosat-2D. The launcher started placing the satellites into polar Sun-synchronous orbits one after another after a flight of 16 minutes and 48 seconds.It first ejected the satellite Cartosat-2D at an altitude of approximately 510 kilometres (320 mi), with 97.46 degrees inclination,[1] followed by the two ISRO nanosatellites INS-1A and INS-1B. It then took 11 minutes for PSLV C-37 to place the remaining 101 "co-passenger" satellites into their intended orbits.

           Soon after separation from the launch vehicle, the two solar arrays on board the Cartosat-2D satellite were automatically deployed. Afterwards, ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru took control of the satellite. "In the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration following which it will begin to provide remote sensing services using its panchromatic (black and white) and multispectral (colour) cameras," an ISRO statement read. The mission lasted 29 minutes.

           With this launch, ISRO created a new world record for the largest number of satellites ever launched on a single rocket, surpassing the previous record of Russia, which in 2014 launched 37 satellites using Dnepr rocket.

           Originally, PSLV-C37 was set to launch on 27 January 2017 with 83 satellites. With the addition of twenty more satellites to the payload, the schedule was changed to 15 February 2017.
